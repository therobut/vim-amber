Vim syntax highlighting for [amber](https://github.com/eknkc/amber) templates.

Installation
------------

I prefer to install plugins using
[vundle.vim](http://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.Vim).  

    Plugin "therobut/vim-amber"

If you do not want to use Vundle, you can always use another plugin manager of your choice,
or you can always install vim-amber in the 
normal manner by copying each directory to your ~/.vim directory.  Make sure 
not to overwrite any existing directory of the same name and instead copy only 
the contents of the source directory to the directory of the same name in your 
~/.vim directory.
